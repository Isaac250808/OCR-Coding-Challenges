# **1 - Factorial Finder**
The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.

## Planning:
I need to:
-   In recursion, keep multiplying each number with the next one, with each instance of the subroutine having a value of 1 less to multiply with the last, until it reaches 0, when 0^0 is 1, so 1 is returned
-   In the loop, keep a total, and times the total by a number, where each pass of the loop decreases the number by 1, until it is 0, then prints the total as the result
## Evaluation:
I found it easy for the looped one, but for the recursion one, because we haven't learnt recursion fully at the time of this challenge, I found it harder, but they were both quite simple.
