# OCR-Coding-Challenges
I have (/would have) completed all of the 80 OCR Coding Challenges, and put the code in this repo

The link to the PDF where these are found are here: https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/260930-coding-challenges-booklet.pdf

I have also added the PDF file to this repo

There are different folders for different languages I tried these in. They are as follows:
- Python
- Pseudocode (CIE A-Level (9618))

For these languages, I used these IDEs:
- Python - https://codewith.mu/ (simplistic, quick)
- Psuedocode - https://pseudocode.pro/9618 (online IDE, worked better than one I found on VSCode)

My explainations for how I did each challenge are only in the Python folder. The other folders are purely for code.
